![phot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad53e7fe-f35c-4a17-a1c6-6743c1305576)

## Description
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Python by creating classes that represent a smartphone and its functionalities, as well as implementing polymorphism through different vehicle and animal classes.

## Classes
- **Smartphone**: Represents a smartphone with attributes like brand, model, and storage. It includes methods to make calls and take photos.
- **SuperSmartphone**: Inherits from `Smartphone` and overrides the `take_photo` method to include camera quality.
- **Car**: Represents a car with a `move` method that returns "Driving üöó".
- **Plane**: Represents a plane with a `move` method that returns "Flying ‚úàÔ∏è".
- **Animal**: Represents an animal with a `move` method that returns "Moving in an unspecified way."

## Usage
To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
py assignment.py
```

This will demonstrate the functionalities of the classes and their methods.

## License
This project is open for educational purposes.
